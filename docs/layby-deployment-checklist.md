## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Required If**:
- Critical functionality broken (cannot create/view laybys)
- Data corruption detected
- Database errors preventing normal operation
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Application crashes/unrecoverable errors
- More than 10% of requests failing

**Consider Rollback If**:
- Non-critical features broken but workaround available
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Multiple user reports of issues
- Integration failures affecting business operations

### Rollback Steps

#### Step 1: Decision and Communication
- [ ] Rollback decision made by: _____________

#### Step 2: Database Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Only if database changes causing issues
- [ ] Stop application
- [ ] Restore database from pre-deployment backup
- [ ] Verify database restore successful
