## Tips and Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Office Supplies" not "Supplies")
- Be consistent with capitalization
- Use specific subcategories (e.g., "Printer Paper" not just "Paper")

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use special characters or numbers in names
- Create overly generic categories (e.g., "Miscellaneous")
- Duplicate similar names (e.g., "Office Supply" and "Office Supplies")

### Organization Hierarchy

**Good Structure:**
```
üìÅ Office Expenses
  ‚îú‚îÄ üìù Stationery
  ‚îú‚îÄ üñ•Ô∏è Computer Equipment
  ‚îú‚îÄ ü™ë Furniture
  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚òï Pantry Supplies
```

**Poor Structure:**
```
üìÅ Expenses
  ‚îú‚îÄ Item 1
  ‚îú‚îÄ Item 2
  ‚îî‚îÄ Other
```

### Emoji Selection

- Use emojis that visually represent the category
- Be consistent across similar categories
- Use popular emojis (‚≠ê) for frequently used categories
- Don't worry about finding the "perfect" emoji - you can always change it later

### Color Coding

- Use colors strategically (by department, expense type, etc.)
- Limit your color palette to 5-7 colors for consistency
- Document your color scheme for other users

### Maintenance

- Review your category structure quarterly
- Consolidate rarely-used subcategories
- Archive old categories by creating a domain-specific "Archive" category
- Train new users on the existing structure

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: I can't see the "Add Category" button

**Solution:** You don't have `canCreateBusinessCategories` permission. Contact your administrator.

### Problem: Emoji picker is slow

**Solution:**
- Local search is instant - use more specific keywords
- GitHub search takes 1-2 seconds - this is normal
- Previously searched GitHub emojis are cached and load instantly

### Problem: I accidentally deleted a category

**Solution:**
- If it had subcategories, you couldn't have deleted it
- If it's truly deleted, you'll need to recreate it
- For future: Take notes before deleting important categories

### Problem: My changes aren't showing up

**Solution:**
- Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- Clear your browser cache
- Check if you're looking at the correct domain
