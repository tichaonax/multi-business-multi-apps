## Introduction

### What is Layby?

Layby (also called lay-away) is a payment method that allows customers to reserve items by making a deposit, then paying the balance through regular installments. Once fully paid, the customer receives their items.

**Benefits:**
- Helps customers afford larger purchases
- Secures sales for your business
- Builds customer loyalty
- Provides predictable payment schedules

### Key Concepts

**Layby Agreement**: A contract between your business and the customer to reserve items
**Deposit**: Initial payment required to start a layby (e.g., 20% of total)
**Installment**: Regular payment amount (e.g., $50 every fortnight)
**Balance**: Amount still owing on the layby
**Completion**: When layby is fully paid and items are released to customer
