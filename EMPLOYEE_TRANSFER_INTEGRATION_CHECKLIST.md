**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Integration & Flow  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## üîó Integration Points

### 1. Deletion Flow Integration ‚úÖ

**Status:** COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Deletion service checks for active employees
- ‚úÖ Both hard and soft delete block when employees exist
- ‚úÖ Error messages guide users to transfer first
- ‚úÖ UI shows transfer button when employees detected
- ‚úÖ Transfer modal launches from deletion modal
- ‚úÖ Deletion impact refreshes after successful transfer
- ‚úÖ Proper transaction ordering maintained

**Files Updated:**

```

### 2. Contract Renewal Integration ‚úÖ

**Status:** COMPLETE - Already exists in system

- ‚úÖ Contract renewals table exists in schema
- ‚úÖ Employee transfer service creates renewal records
- ‚úÖ Renewals created with status='pending', isAutoRenewal=true
- ‚úÖ Due date set to 7 days from creation
- ‚úÖ Pending tasks API includes contract renewals
- ‚úÖ HR can view and process transfer renewals

**Schema Confirmed:**
```prisma
model ContractRenewals {
  id                String    @id @default(cuid())
  originalContractId String
  newContractId      String?
  status             String    // 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
  requestedBy        String
  requestedAt        DateTime  @default(now())
  processedBy        String?
  processedAt        DateTime?
  dueDate            DateTime
  isAutoRenewal      Boolean   @default(false)
  notes              String?
  // ... relations
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/pending-tasks` - Lists pending contract renewals
- ‚úÖ Contract renewal processing workflow exists

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check renewals created by transfer
SELECT 
  cr.id,
  cr.status,
  cr.isAutoRenewal,
  cr.dueDate,
  e.fullName,
  ec.contractNumber
FROM contract_renewals cr
JOIN employee_contracts ec ON cr.originalContractId = ec.id
JOIN employees e ON ec.employeeId = e.id
WHERE cr.isAutoRenewal = true
  AND cr.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY cr.requestedAt DESC;
```

### 3. Employee Management Integration ‚úÖ

**Status:** COMPLETE - Verified schema and relationships

- ‚úÖ Employees appear in new business employee list
- ‚úÖ Employee.primaryBusinessId updated correctly
- ‚úÖ Business assignments track old (inactive) and new (primary)
- ‚úÖ Employee detail page shows correct primary business
- ‚úÖ Contract history preserved (historical records)

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Primary business relationship
employees.primaryBusinessId ‚Üí businesses.id

-- Business assignments (many-to-many)
employee_business_assignments
  - employeeId
  - businessId
  - isPrimary (true for new, false for old)
  - isActive (false for old, true for new)
  - assignedAt
```

**Service Layer:**
```typescript
// In transferEmployeesToBusiness():
// 1. Update employee.primaryBusinessId
await tx.employees.update({
  where: { id: employeeId },
  data: { primaryBusinessId: targetBusinessId }
})

// 2. Mark old assignment as inactive
await tx.employeeBusinessAssignments.updateMany({
  where: { 
    employeeId, 
    businessId: sourceBusinessId,
    isPrimary: true
  },
  data: { 
    isPrimary: false,
    isActive: false
  }
})

// 3. Create new primary assignment
await tx.employeeBusinessAssignments.create({
  data: {
    employeeId,
    businessId: targetBusinessId,
    isPrimary: true,
    isActive: true
  }
})
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Verify employee assignments
SELECT 
  e.fullName,
  e.employeeNumber,
  e.primaryBusinessId,
  b.name AS primaryBusiness,
  eba.businessId AS assignedBusiness,
  eba.isPrimary,
  eba.isActive,
  eba.assignedAt
FROM employees e
JOIN businesses b ON e.primaryBusinessId = b.id
LEFT JOIN employee_business_assignments eba ON e.id = eba.employeeId
WHERE e.id = '{employeeId}'
ORDER BY eba.assignedAt DESC;
```

### 4. Payroll Integration Check ‚úÖ

**Status:** VERIFIED - No changes needed

- ‚úÖ Payroll queries use employee.primaryBusinessId
- ‚úÖ Transferred employees appear in target business payroll
- ‚úÖ Payroll periods tied to business
- ‚úÖ Payroll export includes correct employees

**Payroll Schema:**
```sql
-- Payroll linked via primaryBusinessId
payroll_periods.businessId ‚Üí businesses.id
employees.primaryBusinessId ‚Üí businesses.id

-- Payroll processing
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE primaryBusinessId = '{businessId}'
  AND isActive = true
```

**No Manual Steps Required:**
- Payroll automatically includes transferred employees
- Based on employee.primaryBusinessId at time of payroll run
- Historical payroll records preserved
- Future payroll uses new primary business

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check employee payroll eligibility
SELECT 
  e.fullName,
  e.employeeNumber,
  e.primaryBusinessId,
  b.name AS primaryBusiness,
  pp.id AS payrollPeriodId,
  pp.startDate,
  pp.endDate,
  pp.status
FROM employees e
JOIN businesses b ON e.primaryBusinessId = b.id
LEFT JOIN payroll_periods pp ON pp.businessId = b.id
WHERE e.id = '{employeeId}'
  AND pp.status = 'active'
ORDER BY pp.startDate DESC;
```

## üß™ Integration Testing

### Test Script Created ‚úÖ

**File:** `test-employee-transfer.js`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Preview mode (validation only)
node test-employee-transfer.js <sourceBusinessId> <targetBusinessId>

# Execute mode (actual transfer)
TEST_EXECUTE=true node test-employee-transfer.js <sourceBusinessId> <targetBusinessId>
```

**Test Flow:**
1. ‚úÖ Fetch transferable employees
2. ‚úÖ Get compatible target businesses
3. ‚úÖ Preview transfer (validation)
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è  Execute transfer (optional)
5. ‚úÖ Verify results

---

## üìä Verification Queries

### Check Transfer Completeness

```sql
-- 1. Verify employee primary business updated
SELECT id, fullName, primaryBusinessId 
FROM employees 
WHERE id IN ('emp1', 'emp2', 'emp3');

-- 2. Verify contract renewals created
SELECT * FROM contract_renewals 
WHERE isAutoRenewal = true 
  AND status = 'pending'
  AND requestedAt >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- 3. Verify business assignments
SELECT * FROM employee_business_assignments
WHERE employeeId IN ('emp1', 'emp2', 'emp3')
ORDER BY assignedAt DESC;

-- 4. Check audit logs
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'EMPLOYEES_TRANSFERRED'
  AND createdAt >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```
