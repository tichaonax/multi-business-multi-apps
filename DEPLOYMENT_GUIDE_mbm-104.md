## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup Database

**Priority**: HIGH - Always backup before schema changes

```bash
# On production server
pg_dump -U postgres -d multi_business_db > backup_pre_mbm104_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup created
ls -lh backup_pre_mbm104_*.sql
```

**Expected**: Backup file created with timestamp

---

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

**Branch**: `mbm-103/phase3-pr` ‚Üí `main`

```bash
# On local machine
git status
# Verify clean working directory

# Review changes one final time
git diff main..mbm-103/phase3-pr

# Merge to main (or create PR)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge mbm-103/phase3-pr
git push origin main
```

**Files Changed**:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated BusinessCategories unique constraint
- `src/app/api/inventory/[businessId]/categories/route.ts` - Query by businessType
- `prisma/migrations/20251031000000_shared_categories_by_type/` - New migration

**Files Added**:
- `scripts/consolidate-categories.ts` - Pre-migration deduplication
- `scripts/check-categories-state.ts` - Database analysis
- `scripts/seed-missing-categories.ts` - Type-level seeding
- `scripts/test-category-sharing.ts` - Test suite
- `scripts/verify-domain-templates.ts` - Template verification
- `scripts/phase6-comprehensive-tests.ts` - Comprehensive tests
- `scripts/verify-phase4-not-needed.ts` - Phase 4 analysis
- Various documentation files

---

### Step 3: Pre-Migration Verification

**Check current database state before migration**

```bash
# On production server
npx tsx scripts/check-categories-state.ts
```

**Expected Output**:
- List of businesses by type
- Category counts per business type
- Sample categories

**Save this output** for comparison after migration.

---

### Step 4: Run Data Consolidation (Optional)

**Only needed if duplicate categories exist**

```bash
# Check for duplicates first
npx tsx scripts/consolidate-categories.ts
```

**Expected**:
- If duplicates found: They will be consolidated automatically
- If no duplicates: "No duplicate categories found! Safe to migrate."

**Note**: This script updates product references and removes duplicates safely.

---

### Step 5: Apply Database Migration

**Apply the schema migration to production**

```bash
# On production server
cd /path/to/multi-business-multi-apps

# Review migration SQL
cat prisma/migrations/20251031000000_shared_categories_by_type/migration.sql

# Apply migration
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Expected Output**:
```
The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
  ‚îî‚îÄ 20251031000000_shared_categories_by_type/
    ‚îî‚îÄ migration.sql

All migrations have been successfully applied.
```

**What This Does**:
1. Drops old unique constraint: `business_categories_businessId_name_key`
2. Adds new unique constraint: `business_categories_businessType_name_key`

---

### Step 6: Regenerate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

**Expected**: Prisma client regenerated with new schema

---

### Step 7: Restart Application

```bash
# Restart application server (adjust command for your setup)
pm2 restart multi-business-app
# OR
systemctl restart multi-business-app
# OR
docker-compose restart app
```

**Verify application started successfully**:
```bash
# Check logs
pm2 logs multi-business-app --lines 50
# OR
tail -f /var/log/multi-business-app.log
```

**Look for**:
- ‚úÖ "Server started on port 3000"
- ‚úÖ "Database connected"
- ‚ùå No error messages about schema or database

---

### Step 8: Post-Deployment Verification

#### 8.1 Run Verification Scripts

```bash
# Verify domain templates
npx tsx scripts/verify-domain-templates.ts

# Expected: 16 domain templates found
```

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npx tsx scripts/phase6-comprehensive-tests.ts

# Expected: 8/8 tests pass (100%)
```

#### 8.2 Database State Verification

```bash
# Check categories after migration
npx tsx scripts/check-categories-state.ts

# Compare with pre-migration output saved in Step 3
```

**Expected**:
- Same category counts per business type
- Categories now enforcing type-level uniqueness

#### 8.3 Manual UI Testing

**Test 1: View Existing Business Categories**
1. Log into application
2. Navigate to any existing business with categories
3. Go to inventory section
4. Verify category dropdown populated
5. ‚úÖ Expected: Categories appear as before

**Test 2: Create New Business**
1. Navigate to admin panel
2. Create new business (e.g., "Test Clothing Store", type: clothing)
3. Go to inventory section for new business
4. Check category dropdown
5. ‚úÖ Expected: Categories already populated (5 for clothing)

**Test 3: Add Custom Category**
1. In any business, add new category (e.g., "Custom Test Category")
2. Save successfully
3. Open different business of SAME type
4. Check categories dropdown
5. ‚úÖ Expected: Custom category visible in other same-type business
6. Check different business type
7. ‚úÖ Expected: Custom category NOT visible (different type)

**Test 4: Add Inventory Item**
1. In any business, add new inventory item
2. Select category from dropdown
3. Save successfully
4. ‚úÖ Expected: Item saved with category

#### 8.4 Check for Errors

```bash
# Monitor application logs for 5 minutes
tail -f /var/log/multi-business-app.log | grep -i error

# Check database connections
# Should see no connection errors
```

## üîç Validation Queries

### Query 1: Verify Unique Constraint

```sql
-- Check constraint exists
SELECT conname, contype 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'business_categories'::regclass 
  AND conname = 'business_categories_businessType_name_key';

-- Expected: 1 row (constraint exists)
```

### Query 2: Check Category Distribution

```sql
-- Count categories by business type
SELECT "businessType", COUNT(*) as category_count
FROM business_categories
WHERE "isActive" = true
GROUP BY "businessType"
ORDER BY "businessType";

-- Expected: 
-- clothing: 5-6
-- grocery: 6
-- hardware: 5
-- restaurant: 8
```

### Query 3: Verify No Duplicates

```sql
-- Check for duplicate (businessType, name) - should return 0 rows
SELECT "businessType", name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM business_categories
GROUP BY "businessType", name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Expected: 0 rows (no duplicates)
```

### Query 4: Check Product References

```sql
-- Verify all products still have valid category references
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_products
FROM business_products bp
LEFT JOIN business_categories bc ON bp."categoryId" = bc.id
WHERE bc.id IS NULL AND bp."categoryId" IS NOT NULL;

-- Expected: 0 (no orphaned products)
```

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback

Rollback if:
- Migration fails with errors
- Application won't start after migration
- Critical functionality broken
- Data corruption detected
- Performance severely degraded

### Rollback Steps

#### Option 1: Revert Schema Migration (Quick)

```bash
# Restore original unique constraint
npx prisma db execute --stdin <<EOF
-- Restore old constraint
ALTER TABLE business_categories 
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS business_categories_businessType_name_key;

ALTER TABLE business_categories 
  ADD CONSTRAINT business_categories_businessId_name_key 
  UNIQUE ("businessId", name);
EOF

# Regenerate Prisma client with reverted schema
# (Manually revert schema.prisma first)
npx prisma generate

# Restart application
pm2 restart multi-business-app
```

#### Option 2: Full Database Restore (If Needed)

```bash
# Stop application
pm2 stop multi-business-app

# Restore from backup
psql -U postgres -d multi_business_db < backup_pre_mbm104_TIMESTAMP.sql

# Verify restore
psql -U postgres -d multi_business_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business_categories;"

# Restart with previous code version
git checkout main~1  # Or specific previous commit
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart multi-business-app
```

#### Option 3: Revert Git Changes

```bash
# If code is the issue, not database
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Redeploy previous version
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart multi-business-app
```

## üìù Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)

- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Watch for user reports of issues
- [ ] Verify category dropdown works in all business types
- [ ] Check performance metrics (response times, CPU, memory)
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### Short-Term (Week 1)

- [ ] Gather user feedback on new category experience
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Review any support tickets related to categories
- [ ] Consider optimizations if needed

### Long-Term

- [ ] Add index on `businessType` if query performance degrades
- [ ] Consider UI improvements (system vs custom category indicators)
- [ ] Plan for additional business types if needed
- [ ] Update user documentation/help guides

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration Fails with Duplicate Error

**Error**: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "business_categories_businessType_name_key"`

**Cause**: Duplicate category names exist for same business type

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run consolidation script
npx tsx scripts/consolidate-categories.ts

# Then retry migration
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Issue: Categories Not Appearing for New Business

**Check**:
1. Verify business type is correct
2. Check if categories exist for that type:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM business_categories WHERE "businessType" = 'clothing';
   ```
3. Check API logs for errors

**Solution**: If no categories exist for type, run seeding:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-missing-categories.ts
```

### Issue: Application Won't Start After Migration

**Check**:
```bash
# Check Prisma client generation
npm ls @prisma/client

# Regenerate if needed
npx prisma generate
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx prisma generate
pm2 restart multi-business-app
```

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Check**: Query performance on `businessType`

**Solution**: Add index if needed:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_business_categories_businessType 
ON business_categories("businessType") WHERE "isActive" = true;
```
