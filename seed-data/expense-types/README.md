## 📚 Usage Guidelines

### For Seed Data Implementation
1. Each category file can be parsed independently
2. Emoji codes are consistent across all files
3. Cross-references allow for multi-category assignment
4. Use the master list for complete validation

### Database Schema Considerations
```
expense_types:
  - id (UUID)
  - name (string)
  - emoji (string)
  - description (text)
  - is_active (boolean)

expense_type_categories:
  - id (UUID)
  - expense_type_id (FK)
  - category (enum: groceries, hardware, restaurant, personal, business, vehicle, clothing, construction)
  - is_primary (boolean)
```

### Business Rules
1. An expense type can belong to multiple categories
2. Each expense type should have exactly one primary category
3. Emojis should be unique per expense type
- Names should be descriptive and searchable
