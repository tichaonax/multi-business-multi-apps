# UI Workflow Context

Focuses the AI on user interface design, layout strategy, and UX consistency.

## Purpose

To ensure UI changes maintain visual consistency, accessibility, and clarity.

## Guidelines

1. Respect established component library principles
2. Keep layouts responsive using defined breakpoints; test for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
3. Do not introduce arbitrary design patternsâ€”reuse existing ones.
4. Prioritize accessibility (focus states, ARIA roles, semantic HTML).
5. Adhere to branding/spacing tokens from theme definitions. (e.g Colors: Hex codes for the brand's primary, secondary, and accent colors.
   Typography: The approved font families, font sizes, and font weights.
   Borders and shadows: Standardized border widths, radii, and shadow effects.)
6. Before implementation, sketch a structural outline or wireframe in text.
7. When adjusting elements, document pixel or rem-level changes with reasoning.
8. Always verify hover, focus, and disabled states for completeness.
