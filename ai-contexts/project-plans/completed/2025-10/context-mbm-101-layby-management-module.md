## üéØ Business Overview

### What is Layby?
Layby (lay-away) is a payment method where customers can reserve items by paying a deposit, then make installment payments over time until the item is fully paid and can be collected. This helps customers afford larger purchases and helps businesses secure sales.

### Business Problem
Currently, the system has partial layby infrastructure (database schema, permissions) but lacks the complete workflow implementation for managing laybys, tracking payments, applying fees, and automating notifications.

### Current State (50% Complete)
**‚úÖ Already Implemented:**
- Database schema exists in backup (`customer_laybys`, `customer_layby_payments` tables)
- Permission system integration (`canManageLaybys` permission)
- Customer-level layby enablement (`allowLayby` field in BusinessCustomers)
- Customer statistics display (layby counts in customer grid/detail modal)
- Order system integration (LAYAWAY payment method exists)
- Multi-business compatibility across all business types

**‚ùå Missing Implementation:**
- Dedicated layby management UI workflows
- Layby creation and editing interfaces
- Payment recording and tracking UI
- Item release and completion workflows
- Business rule configuration per business type
- Automation (payment reminders, late fees, defaults)
- SMS/Email notification system

### Database Transaction Patterns

**Creating Layby (Atomic Transaction):**
```typescript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Create layby record
  const layby = await tx.customerLayby.create({ ... })

  // 2. Reserve inventory
  await reserveInventory(tx, layby.items, layby.businessId)

  // 3. Create initial BusinessTransaction record
  await tx.businessTransactions.create({
    type: 'LAYBY_CREATED',
    amount: layby.depositAmount,
    // ...
  })

  return layby
})
```

**Recording Payment (Atomic Transaction):**
```typescript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Create payment record
  const payment = await tx.customerLaybyPayment.create({ ... })

  // 2. Update layby balance
  const updatedLayby = await tx.customerLayby.update({
    where: { id: laybyId },
    data: {
      totalPaid: { increment: amount },
      balanceRemaining: { decrement: amount },
      status: isFullyPaid ? 'COMPLETED' : status
    }
  })

  // 3. Create BusinessTransaction
  await tx.businessTransactions.create({
    type: 'LAYBY_PAYMENT',
    amount: amount,
    // ...
  })

  // 4. If fully paid, create order
  if (isFullyPaid && createOrder) {
    await createOrderFromLayby(tx, updatedLayby)
  }

  return { payment, layby: updatedLayby }
})
```

### Performance Benchmarks

**API Response Times:**
- GET /api/laybys (list with filters): < 300ms
- POST /api/laybys (create): < 500ms
- POST /api/laybys/[id]/payments (record payment): < 400ms
- GET /api/laybys/[id] (detail view): < 200ms

**Database Query Optimization:**
- Indexes on: `businessId`, `customerId`, `status`, `paymentDueDate`
- Composite index on: `(businessId, status, paymentDueDate)`
- Pagination limits: 50 items per page (list views)
- Use `select` to limit returned fields
- Eager load relations only when needed

**Frontend Performance:**
- Page load (list): < 2 seconds
- Page load (detail): < 1.5 seconds
- Form submission: < 1 second response
- Real-time balance updates: < 500ms
- Lazy load payment history (pagination)

### Error Handling Standards

**API Error Responses:**
```typescript
// Validation Error (400)
{
  error: 'Validation error',
  details: [
    { field: 'depositAmount', message: 'Deposit must be at least 20%' }
  ]
}

// Not Found (404)
{
  error: 'Layby not found',
  laybyId: 'abc123'
}

// Business Rule Violation (400)
{
  error: 'Cannot complete layby',
  reason: 'Balance remaining is $50.00',
  balanceRemaining: 50.00
}

// Insufficient Stock (400)
{
  error: 'Insufficient stock',
  products: [
    { productId: 'xyz', requested: 5, available: 3 }
  ]
}
```

**Status Transition Validation:**
- ACTIVE ‚Üí COMPLETED: Only if balance = 0
- ACTIVE ‚Üí CANCELLED: Allowed anytime
- ACTIVE ‚Üí ON_HOLD: Allowed anytime
- ACTIVE ‚Üí DEFAULTED: Only via automation
- ON_HOLD ‚Üí ACTIVE: Allowed (reactivate)
- DEFAULTED ‚Üí ACTIVE: Allowed (reactivate with new terms)
- COMPLETED ‚Üí Any: Not allowed (completed is final)
- CANCELLED ‚Üí Any: Not allowed (cancelled is final)

### Testing Specifications

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- Deposit calculation logic: 100%
- Fee application logic: 100%
- Balance calculation: 100%
- Status transition validation: 100%
- Business rule validation: 100%
- Layby number generation: 100%

**Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. Create layby ‚Üí Verify database records + inventory reservation

## üêõ Phase 11: Critical Bug Fixes (Post-Completion)

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. False Overdue Alerts ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Laybys incorrectly showing as overdue when customer was compliant (overdue amount = $0.00)

**Root Cause:** Payment due date not advancing after each payment was recorded

**Solution:**
- Implemented automatic payment due date advancement based on installment frequency
- Added smart overdue detection requiring BOTH:
  - Payment date has passed AND
  - Overdue amount > $0

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Auto-advance payment due date after payment
const calculateNextPaymentDate = (currentDueDate: Date, frequency: string): Date | null => {
  if (!currentDueDate || isFullyPaid) return null
  const nextDate = new Date(currentDueDate)

  switch (frequency) {
    case 'WEEKLY': nextDate.setDate(nextDate.getDate() + 7); break
    case 'FORTNIGHTLY': nextDate.setDate(nextDate.getDate() + 14); break
    case 'MONTHLY': nextDate.setMonth(nextDate.getMonth() + 1); break
    case 'CUSTOM': nextDate.setDate(nextDate.getDate() + 14); break
  }
  return nextDate
}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminated false overdue alerts confusing staff
- ‚úÖ Automated payment due date tracking
- ‚úÖ Accurate compliance status

#### 2. Unclear Overdue Amounts ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Staff couldn't see specific payment amount overdue (deposit vs installment)

**Solution:** Display exact overdue amount with clear labels
- "Deposit Overdue: $15.60" (when no payments made)
- "Payment Overdue: $12.40" (when installment missed)

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Clear actionable information for staff
- ‚úÖ Faster payment collection

#### 3. Missing Customer Information ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Customer cards not showing phone numbers, email, city, company names

**Root Cause:** Database field names (`name`, `email`, `phone`) didn't match frontend expectations (`fullName`, `primaryEmail`, `primaryPhone`)

**Solution:** Added field mapping layer in customers API
```typescript
const customers = customersRaw.map((customer) => ({
  fullName: customer.name,
  primaryEmail: customer.email,
  primaryPhone: customer.phone,
  companyName: (customer.attributes as any)?.companyName || null,
  // ... other fields
}))
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Complete customer information visible
- ‚úÖ Better customer service and communication

#### 4. Customers API 500 Error ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Customers page crashing with 500 error

**Root Cause:** Attempting to include non-existent `customer_credit_applications` relation

**Solution:** Removed non-existent relation, set credit applications count to 0

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Customers page loads reliably
- ‚úÖ No crashes during normal operations

### Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/laybys/[id]/payments/route.ts` (+30 lines)
   - Added automatic payment due date advancement

2. `src/components/laybys/layby-alerts-widget.tsx` (+25 lines)
   - Smart overdue detection logic
   - Specific overdue amount display

3. `src/components/laybys/layby-list.tsx` (+15 lines)
   - Smart overdue detection in list view

4. `src/app/api/customers/route.ts` (+45 lines, -10 lines)

- [x] Deposit payment ‚Üí Due date advances correctly
- [x] Compliant layby ‚Üí NOT shown as overdue
- [x] Actual missed payment ‚Üí Shown as overdue
- [x] All frequencies tested (WEEKLY, FORTNIGHTLY, MONTHLY)

**Customer Information:**
- [x] Phone numbers displayed
- [x] Email addresses displayed
- [x] Company names displayed
- [x] City information displayed
- [x] No API errors

### Business Impact

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced staff confusion from false alerts
- ‚úÖ Faster payment collection with clear amounts
- ‚úÖ Better customer service with complete information
- ‚úÖ Reliable system operation

**Risk Level:** Low
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible
- No database schema changes

### Additional Requirements from Phase 11

**Functional Requirements:**
- [x] System must automatically advance payment due date after each payment based on installment frequency
- [x] Overdue detection must check both payment date AND overdue amount before flagging as overdue
- [x] Layby alerts must display specific overdue amount (deposit vs installment payment)
- [x] Customers API must map database field names to frontend expectations
- [x] Customers API must only include existing database relations

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- [x] No performance degradation from changes
- [x] All changes backward compatible
- [x] Error handling maintained
- [x] Real-world testing validated

**Data Requirements:**
- Payment due date advancement formula:
  - WEEKLY: current date + 7 days
  - FORTNIGHTLY: current date + 14 days
  - MONTHLY: current date + 1 month
  - CUSTOM: current date + 14 days (default)

**API Requirements:**
- Payment recording API must update `paymentDueDate` field
- Customers API must map: `name` ‚Üí `fullName`, `email` ‚Üí `primaryEmail`, `phone` ‚Üí `primaryPhone`
- Customers API must extract `companyName` from `attributes` JSON field

### Lessons Learned

1. **Payment Due Date Management:** Critical for accurate overdue detection - must advance after each payment
2. **Multi-Factor Validation:** Overdue status requires both temporal (date) and quantitative (amount) checks
3. **Field Name Mapping:** Database and frontend naming conventions often differ - mapping layer needed
4. **Relation Validation:** Always verify database relations exist before including in Prisma queries
5. **Real-World Testing:** Some bugs only appear with actual data and user workflows

### Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update user manual with auto-advancement behavior
- [ ] Document overdue detection algorithm in admin guide
- [ ] Add field mapping to API documentation
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide with these fixes
