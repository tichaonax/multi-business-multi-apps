## üöÄ Session Objective

<!-- Fill in your specific feature requirements before starting -->

**Ticket:** mbm-100

**Feature Name:** Business Expense Categories Management

**Feature Description:**
1. Need ability to make changes add/remove/update to the business categories and subcategories.
2. User can change the emoji or description of the category or subcategory
3. For changing the emoji, the app needs to use the description as a clue for potential emoji matches and show user a dropdown of available emojis.
4. App should first search the existing local emoji database (fast, offline)
5. Optional: If app has internet access, user can click "Find more on GitHub" to fetch additional emojis from GitHub's official gemoji API (https://api.github.com/emojis) - free, public, no auth required
6. The fetched emojis must then be added to a local database lookup with the matching description so that future searches look in the local database first
7. Maintain the fetched emojis in a lookup database table with usage tracking 
**Target Module/Component:**
- Current: http://localhost:8080/personal/categories (read-only)
- New: http://localhost:8080/business/categories (full CRUD management)

**API Endpoints (if applicable):**
- POST/GET /api/business/categories - Create and list categories
- PUT/DELETE /api/business/categories/[id] - Update and delete specific category
- POST/GET /api/business/subcategories - Create and list subcategories
- PUT/DELETE /api/business/subcategories/[id] - Update and delete specific subcategory
- GET /api/business/emoji-lookup - Search cached emojis
- POST /api/business/emoji-lookup - Save emoji to cache
- GET /api/business/emoji-github - Fetch emojis from GitHub API (optional)

**UI/UX Requirements:**
1. Move the module from /personal/categories to /business/categories (this is a business-wide capability, not personal)
2. Add action buttons (Add, Edit, Delete) gated by permissions
3. Modal forms for creating/editing categories and subcategories
4. Enhanced emoji picker with:
   - Instant search in local database
   - Optional "Find more on GitHub" button
   - Source badges (üè† Local, üêô GitHub, ‚≠ê Cached)
   - Sort by: cached ‚Üí local ‚Üí GitHub, then by usage count
5. Delete confirmation dialogs with clear error messages
6. Responsive design (works on mobile)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ‚úÖ User can add/edit/remove categories and subcategories
2. ‚úÖ Each category/subcategory must have an emoji (required field)
3. ‚úÖ Cannot delete a category if there are subcategories beneath it or if it's in use by expenses
4. ‚úÖ Cannot remove a subcategory already in use by expenses
5. ‚úÖ Cannot have a duplicate category with the same name in the same business (case-insensitive)
6. ‚úÖ Cannot have duplicate subcategory with the same name in the same category (case-insensitive)
7. ‚úÖ Needs 6 separate permissions (different permission sets for categories vs subcategories):
   - canCreateBusinessCategories
   - canEditBusinessCategories
   - canDeleteBusinessCategories
   - canCreateBusinessSubcategories
   - canEditBusinessSubcategories
   - canDeleteBusinessSubcategories
8. ‚úÖ Emoji system works offline-first (uses local database)
9. ‚úÖ Optional GitHub emoji fetching works when online
10. ‚úÖ Fetched emojis are cached and reused across users

## üìê Technical Specifications

**Technologies:**
- Next.js 14 App Router
- React Server Components
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

**Dependencies:**
- No new npm dependencies required
- Uses existing local emoji database (src/lib/data/emoji-database.ts)
- GitHub gemoji API (public, no auth): https://api.github.com/emojis

**Data Models:**
1. **EmojiLookup** (NEW - requires migration):
   ```prisma
   model EmojiLookup {
     id          String   @id @default(uuid())
     emoji       String   // The emoji character
     description String   // Search term used
     name        String?  // Emoji name from GitHub
     url         String?  // GitHub CDN URL
     source      String   // 'local' or 'github'
     fetchedAt   DateTime @default(now())
     usageCount  Int      @default(0)

     @@unique([emoji, description])
     @@map("emoji_lookup")
   }
   ```

2. **Existing Models** (no changes):
   - ExpenseDomains (already exists)
   - ExpenseCategories (already exists)
   - ExpenseSubcategories (already exists)
   - PersonalExpenses (for usage checking)

**Integration Points:**
- Existing emoji picker component (src/components/personal/emoji-picker.tsx) - will be enhanced
- Existing sidebar navigation (src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx) - will be updated
- Existing permission system (src/types/permissions.ts) - will add 6 new permissions
- GitHub API (optional, external): GET https://api.github.com/emojis

**Integration Tests:** (Manual Testing Required)
1. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Create category ‚Üí Edit category ‚Üí Delete category (must have no children, not in use)
   - Create subcategory ‚Üí Edit subcategory ‚Üí Delete subcategory (must not be in use)

2. **Validation Tests:**
   - Attempt duplicate category name (should fail with 409)

   - User with create-only permissions (can only add, not edit/delete)
   - User with edit-only permissions (can only edit, not create/delete)
   - User with delete-only permissions (can only delete, not create/edit)
   - Admin with all permissions (can do everything)

4. **Emoji System Tests:**
   - Search local emoji database (should be instant)
   - Click "Find more on GitHub" when online (should fetch and cache)
   - Try GitHub fetch when offline (should gracefully fallback)
   - Verify cached emojis appear first in future searches
   - Verify usage count increments when emoji is used

**E2E Tests:** (Manual Browser Testing)
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile: Responsive design on phone screen
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Modal interactions (open, close, cancel)
- Error message display
- Success toast notifications

## üìù Session Notes

**Important Decisions:**
1. **Emoji Source Changed:** Originally planned to scrape emojipedia.org, but changed to GitHub gemoji API for legal/ethical reasons
2. **GitHub API Benefits:** Free, public, no authentication, well-documented, reliable
3. **Offline-First:** Local emoji database is primary source, GitHub is optional enhancement
4. **No New Dependencies:** Uses existing tools, no npm packages needed
5. **Permission Granularity:** 6 separate permissions allow fine-grained access control

**Project Plan Location:**
`ai-contexts/project-plans/active/projectplan-mbm-100-business-expense-categories-2025-10-24.md`

**Estimated Effort:**
- Development: 6-8 hours (8 phases, 89 tasks)
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- Total: ~10 hours

**Actual Effort:**
- Implementation Period: October 24-26, 2025 (3 days)
- Total Tasks Completed: 88/89 (99% complete)
- Total Files Created: 12 new files
- Total Files Modified: 39+ files
- Lines of Code Added: ~2,825 lines

**Risk Level:** Very Low
- Non-breaking changes (old routes kept as redirects)
- Graceful degradation (GitHub API is optional)
- Comprehensive validation (prevents data corruption)
- Legitimate external API (GitHub is reliable)
