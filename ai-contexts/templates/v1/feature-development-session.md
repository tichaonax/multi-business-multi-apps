## 📋 Required Context Documents

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting this session, load the following context documents **IN THE EXACT ORDER LISTED BELOW**.

### Core Contexts (Load in this EXACT order - ONE AT A TIME)

**CRITICAL:** Read these files sequentially. Do not proceed to the next document until you have fully read and understood the previous one.

1. **FIRST:** `ai-contexts/master-context.md` - General principles and conventions
   - ⚠️ Contains critical instruction to read code-workflow.md
   - ⚠️ Defines operating principles
   - ⚠️ Contains mandatory workflow enforcement
   - ⚠️ Defines example adherence requirements

2. **SECOND:** `ai-contexts/code-workflow.md` - Standard workflow and task tracking
   - Contains MANDATORY workflow requirements
   - Requires creating project plan BEFORE any code changes
   - Defines approval checkpoint process

### Feature-Specific Contexts (Load as needed after core contexts)

- `ai-contexts/frontend/component-context.md` - For UI component development
- `ai-contexts/frontend/ui-context.md` - For UI consistency and styling
- `ai-contexts/backend/backend-api-context.md` - For API endpoint development
- `ai-contexts/backend/database-context.md` - For database schema changes
- `ai-contexts/testing/unit-testing-context.md` - For test coverage

### Optional Contexts

- Domain-specific contexts based on the module being developed

**How to load:** Use the Read tool to load each relevant context document before beginning work.
