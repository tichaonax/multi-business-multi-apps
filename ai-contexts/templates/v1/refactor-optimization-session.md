## üìã Required Context Documents

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting this session, load the following context documents **IN THE EXACT ORDER LISTED BELOW**.

### Core Contexts (Load in this EXACT order - ONE AT A TIME)

**CRITICAL:** Read these files sequentially. Do not proceed to the next document until you have fully read and understood the previous one.

1. **FIRST:** `ai-contexts/master-context.md` - General principles and conventions
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains critical instruction to read code-workflow.md
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Defines operating principles
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains mandatory workflow enforcement
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Defines example adherence requirements

2. **SECOND:** `ai-contexts/code-workflow.md` - Standard workflow and task tracking
   - Contains MANDATORY workflow requirements
   - Requires creating project plan BEFORE any code changes
   - Defines approval checkpoint process

### Additional Contexts (Load after core contexts)

- `ai-contexts/general-problem-solving-context.md` - Problem analysis methodology
- Optional: domain-specific contexts based on the module
