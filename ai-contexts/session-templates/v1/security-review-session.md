## üìã Required Context Documents

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting this session, load the following context documents:

### Core Contexts (Always Load)
- `ai-contexts/code-workflow.md` - Standard workflow and task tracking
- `ai-contexts/master-context.md` - General principles and conventions

### Security-Relevant Contexts
- `ai-contexts/backend/backend-api-context.md` - API security patterns
- `ai-contexts/backend/database-context.md` - Database security (SQL injection, etc.)
- `ai-contexts/frontend/component-context.md` - Frontend security (XSS, CSRF)

### Optional Contexts
- Domain-specific contexts for the module under review

**How to load:** Use the Read tool to load each relevant context document before beginning security review.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication:**
- [ ] Secure password storage (hashing with salt)
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] Token expiration implemented
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (if applicable)
- [ ] Account lockout on failed attempts
- [ ] Password complexity requirements

**Authorization:**
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- [ ] Permission checks on all sensitive endpoints
- [ ] User data isolation (users can't access others' data)
- [ ] Admin-only routes protected
- [ ] API endpoints check user permissions

### Input Validation & Sanitization

**Backend Validation:**
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] Type checking enforced
- [ ] Length limits applied
- [ ] Format validation (email, phone, etc.)
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (using Prisma/parameterized queries)
- [ ] NoSQL injection prevented

**Frontend Validation:**
- [ ] Client-side validation present (UX)
- [ ] Server-side validation enforced (security)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitize outputs)
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] File upload validation (type, size, content)

### Data Security

**Data Storage:**
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Passwords hashed (bcrypt, argon2, etc.)
- [ ] API keys/secrets not in code
- [ ] Environment variables used for secrets
- [ ] Database connection strings secured
- [ ] PII data handling compliant

**Data Transmission:**
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- [ ] Sensitive data not in URLs
- [ ] API responses don't leak sensitive info

### API Security

**Endpoint Protection:**
- [ ] Authentication required for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Request size limits enforced
- [ ] Error messages don't leak system info
- [ ] Proper HTTP methods used (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

**API Keys & Tokens:**
- [ ] API keys rotated regularly
- [ ] JWT tokens have expiration
- [ ] Refresh token strategy secure
- [ ] Token validation on every request

### Frontend Security

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
- [ ] User input sanitized before rendering
- [ ] React escapes content by default (verify)
- [ ] Dangerous HTML avoided (dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
- [ ] CSRF tokens on state-changing requests
- [ ] SameSite cookie attribute set
- [ ] Origin/Referer header validation

### Dependency Security

**Third-Party Packages:**
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities (npm audit)
- [ ] Unnecessary packages removed
- [ ] Package lock files committed
- [ ] Source verified for critical packages
