## üöÄ Session Objective

<!-- Fill in your specific feature requirements before starting -->

**Feature Name:**
Employee Leave Request Management System

**Feature Description:**
Implement a complete leave request system that allows employees to submit leave requests (vacation, sick leave, personal days), managers to approve/reject requests, and admins to view leave balances and generate reports. The system should track different leave types, validate against available balances, prevent conflicts with existing leave, and send notifications.

**Target Module/Component:**
- Backend: `/api/employees/[employeeId]/leave-requests`
- Frontend: `/src/app/employees/[employeeId]/leave/page.tsx`
- Component: `/src/components/employees/leave-request-form.tsx`
- Component: `/src/components/employees/leave-request-list.tsx`

**API Endpoints (if applicable):**
1. `POST /api/employees/[employeeId]/leave-requests` - Submit new leave request
2. `GET /api/employees/[employeeId]/leave-requests` - List employee's leave requests
3. `GET /api/leave-requests/[requestId]` - Get single leave request details
4. `PUT /api/leave-requests/[requestId]/approve` - Approve leave request (manager only)
5. `PUT /api/leave-requests/[requestId]/reject` - Reject leave request (manager only)
6. `DELETE /api/leave-requests/[requestId]` - Cancel leave request (employee only, if pending)
7. `GET /api/employees/[employeeId]/leave-balance` - Get current leave balance

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- **Leave Request Form:**
  - Date range picker (start date, end date)
  - Leave type dropdown (vacation, sick, personal)
  - Text area for notes/reason
  - Show available balance for selected leave type
  - Validation: prevent past dates, prevent exceeding balance
  - Show conflict warnings if dates overlap with existing requests

- **Leave Request List:**
  - Filterable by status (pending, approved, rejected)
  - Sortable by date, status, type
  - Color-coded status badges (yellow=pending, green=approved, red=rejected)
  - Quick actions: Cancel (if pending), View details
  - Manager view: Shows all team members' requests with approve/reject buttons

- **Leave Balance Card:**
  - Display available days for each leave type
  - Show used vs. total days
  - Progress bar visualization
  - Link to request history

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ‚úÖ Employee can submit leave request with date range and type
2. ‚úÖ System validates request doesn't exceed available balance
3. ‚úÖ System prevents overlapping leave requests for same employee
4. ‚úÖ Manager receives notification when team member submits request
5. ‚úÖ Manager can approve/reject requests with optional comments
6. ‚úÖ Employee receives notification when request is approved/rejected
7. ‚úÖ Employee can cancel pending requests
8. ‚úÖ Leave balance updates automatically when request is approved
9. ‚úÖ Admin can view all leave requests across all employees
10. ‚úÖ System prevents backdated leave requests (must request at least 1 day in advance)

## üìê Technical Specifications

<!-- Add technical details, architecture notes, or design patterns -->

**Technologies:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, NextAuth for authentication
- Database: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- UI Components: Existing component library (button, card, badge, form inputs)
- Date Handling: date-fns library
- Notifications: In-app notification system (existing)

**Dependencies:**
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation and validation
- `react-hook-form` - Form state management
- `zod` - Request validation
- Existing: `@prisma/client`, `next-auth`, `tailwindcss`

**Data Models:**
```prisma
model LeaveRequest {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  employeeId  String   @map("employee_id")
  employee    Employee @relation(fields: [employeeId], references: [id])

  leaveType   LeaveType @map("leave_type")
  startDate   DateTime  @map("start_date")
  endDate     DateTime  @map("end_date")
  daysCount   Int       @map("days_count")

  status      LeaveStatus @default(PENDING)

  reason      String?

  reviewerId  String?   @map("reviewer_id")
  reviewer    User?     @relation("ReviewedLeaveRequests", fields: [reviewerId], references: [id])
  reviewDate  DateTime? @map("review_date")
  reviewNotes String?   @map("review_notes")

  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  @@map("leave_requests")
  @@index([employeeId, status])
  @@index([startDate, endDate])
}

enum LeaveType {
  VACATION
  SICK
  PERSONAL
  UNPAID
}

enum LeaveStatus {
  PENDING
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
  CANCELLED
}

model LeaveBalance {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  employeeId  String   @map("employee_id")
  employee    Employee @relation(fields: [employeeId], references: [id])

  leaveType   LeaveType @map("leave_type")
  totalDays   Int       @map("total_days")
  usedDays    Int       @default(0) @map("used_days")
  year        Int

  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  @@unique([employeeId, leaveType, year])
  @@map("leave_balances")
}
```

**Integration Points:**
1. **Employee Module**: Link from employee detail page to leave management
2. **Notification System**: Send notifications on request submit/approve/reject
3. **Activity Feed**: Log leave request events to recent activity
4. **Permission System**: Check `canManageLeave` permission for managers
5. **Dashboard**: Show pending leave requests count in stats

## üß™ Testing Requirements

<!-- Define test coverage expectations -->

**Unit Tests:**
- Date validation logic (no past dates, no overlaps)
- Leave balance calculation
- Business days calculation (exclude weekends)
- Permission checking logic
- Leave request status transitions

**Integration Tests:**
- API endpoint authentication/authorization
- Database transaction handling (balance updates)
- Notification triggering on status changes
- Conflict detection across multiple requests

**E2E Tests:**
- Employee submits leave request and sees success message
- Manager approves request and employee receives notification
- Employee tries to request more days than available balance (should fail)
- Employee cancels pending request
- Manager rejects request with reason

---

## üìù Session Notes

<!-- Add any additional notes, constraints, or context here -->

**Business Rules:**
- Employees can only submit requests for future dates (minimum 1 day advance notice)
- Weekend days don't count toward leave balance
- Overlapping requests for same employee are not allowed
- Only pending requests can be cancelled
- Approved requests can only be cancelled by manager or admin
- Leave balance resets annually (future enhancement: pro-rated for mid-year hires)

**Design Decisions:**
- Using enum for leave types (easier to extend in future)
- Separate LeaveBalance table for performance (avoid calculating from all requests)
- Soft delete pattern (keep rejected/cancelled requests for audit trail)
- Manager approval required (no auto-approval based on balance)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Calendar view showing team's leave schedule
- Export leave reports to CSV/PDF
- Email notifications (currently only in-app)
- Recurring leave patterns (e.g., every Friday)
- Public holidays integration

**Known Constraints:**
- Business days calculation is basic (doesn't account for company holidays yet)
- No support for half-day leave (all requests are full days)
- Single approver model (no multi-level approval workflow)

## ‚úÖ Start Session

Ready to begin feature development. Please:
1. Review the feature requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Load all required context documents (code-workflow.md, backend-api-context.md, database-context.md, component-context.md)
3. Propose an implementation plan with phases:
   - Phase 1: Database schema (models, migrations)
   - Phase 2: Backend API endpoints with validation
   - Phase 3: Frontend components (form, list, balance card)
   - Phase 4: Integration with notification system
   - Phase 5: Testing
4. Identify technical challenges:
   - Date overlap detection query performance
   - Transaction handling for balance updates
   - Permission checking for managers vs. employees
5. Suggest a testing strategy for each phase
6. Create task-scoped project plan: `projectplan-leave-request-system-2025-10-18.md`
