## üìù Session Notes

<!-- Add any additional context, constraints, or findings -->

**Context:**
- User reported seeing another user's expense in their list
- This is a CRITICAL security issue if confirmed
- Affects trust in the application
- Must be fixed immediately before user data is compromised

**Investigation Priority:**
1. Reproduce the reported issue (critical)
2. Verify IDOR vulnerability exists
3. Audit all personal finance endpoints
4. Check business-level permission model
5. Review user data isolation strategy

**Impact if Vulnerability Confirmed:**
- Users can access other users' financial data
- Users can potentially modify/delete others' data
- Privacy breach - GDPR violation possible
- Loss of user trust
- Potential legal liability

**Testing Approach:**
1. Create two test users (User A, User B)
2. User A creates expense
3. User B tries to access User A's expense by ID
4. User B tries to list expenses (should only see own)
5. Document findings with screenshots/logs

## ‚úÖ Start Session

Ready to begin security review. Please:
1. Load all required context documents (backend-api-context.md, database-context.md, code-workflow.md)
2. Review the target scope (personal finance APIs) and security checklist
3. Investigate reported issue:
   - Read `/api/personal/expenses/route.ts` (list endpoint)
   - Read `/api/personal/expenses/[expenseId]/route.ts` (detail endpoint)
   - Check if queries filter by `userId`
   - Verify authorization middleware is present
4. Analyze code for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10):
   - Broken access control (PRIMARY CONCERN)
   - Missing authorization checks
   - IDOR vulnerabilities
5. Check authentication and authorization implementation:
   - Session validation
   - Permission checks
   - User data isolation
6. Review input validation and sanitization:
   - Zod schema validation
   - Output escaping
7. Verify secrets management:
   - Check for hardcoded secrets
   - Verify .env usage
8. Identify high-risk areas requiring immediate attention:
   - IDOR in expense endpoints
   - Missing rate limiting
   - Missing CSRF protection
9. Propose remediation plan with prioritization:
   - Critical: Fix IDOR (within 24 hours)
   - High: Add user filtering (within 24 hours)
   - Medium: Add rate limiting (within 1 week)
   - Low: Strengthen password policy (within 1 month)

**Expected Findings:**
- Likely to find IDOR vulnerability in expense detail endpoint
- Likely to find missing user ID filtering in some queries
- May find inconsistent permission checking
- Will find missing CSRF protection
- Will find no rate limiting

**Immediate Actions if Vulnerability Confirmed:**
1. Fix IDOR vulnerability immediately
2. Add user filtering to all personal finance queries
3. Deploy hotfix to production
4. Notify users if data was compromised
5. Review audit logs for unauthorized access
