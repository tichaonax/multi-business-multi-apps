## üé® Design Scope

<!-- Define what's being reviewed -->

**Review Type:**
- [x] UI Layout
- [x] Component Architecture
- [ ] Theme/Styling System
- [x] Navigation Flow
- [x] Responsive Design
- [x] Accessibility

**Target Area:**
Employee Detail Page Redesign (`/employees/[employeeId]`)

**Current Issues with Existing Design:**
- Information is scattered across multiple tabs, requiring too many clicks
- Contract history is buried in a separate section
- No visual indication of employee status (active/inactive)
- Salary information not easily visible for managers
- Mobile layout is cramped and hard to navigate
- Action buttons (Edit, Deactivate, etc.) are inconsistent with other pages

**Design Assets:**
- Figma mockup: https://figma.com/file/employee-detail-redesign (not real URL - example)
- Screenshots of current design: `/docs/screenshots/employee-detail-before.png`
- Wireframes for proposed layout: `/docs/wireframes/employee-detail-v2.png`

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Hero Section**: Employee photo, name, role, status badge prominently at top
2. **Info Cards Layout**: Replace tabs with card-based grid layout
3. **Quick Stats**: Show key metrics (tenure, salary, leave balance) in dashboard-style cards
4. **Timeline View**: Replace table with visual timeline for contract/salary history
5. **Action Bar**: Sticky action bar with consistent button placement
6. **Mobile First**: Responsive grid that collapses to single column on mobile

## üìê Review Criteria

<!-- What aspects need evaluation -->

**Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ All current features must remain accessible
- ‚úÖ Quick access to critical information (contact, salary, contracts)
- ‚úÖ Clear path to edit employee details
- ‚úÖ Easy navigation to related features (payroll, leave requests)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Too much information on one page might overwhelm users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Card layout might not scale well with many contracts

**Usability:**
- ‚úÖ Reduces clicks to access key information (removes tab navigation)
- ‚úÖ Visual hierarchy guides user attention to important data
- ‚úÖ Clear call-to-action buttons
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Users accustomed to tabs might find new layout confusing initially
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Scrolling might be required for all information (vs. tab compartmentalization)
- ‚ùì Question: Should we add a floating action button for quick edit?

**Accessibility:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review: Color contrast for status badges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review: Focus states for interactive cards
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review: Screen reader navigation order
- ‚ùì Question: Should cards be keyboard navigable?
- ‚ùì Question: ARIA labels needed for icon-only buttons?

**Performance:**
- ‚úÖ Card layout should render faster than tabs (all content loaded once)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Loading all data at once might slow initial page load
- ‚ùì Question: Should we lazy-load contract history timeline?
- ‚ùì Question: Should we paginate salary history or show last 5 only?

**Maintainability:**
- ‚úÖ Card components can be reused across other detail pages
- ‚úÖ Timeline component is generic and reusable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern: Complex grid layout might be harder to maintain than simple tabs
- ‚úÖ Responsive grid uses Tailwind utilities (consistent with codebase)

**Consistency:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Different from project detail page (still uses tabs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Different from contractor detail page (uses accordion)
- ‚ùì Question: Should we standardize all detail pages to use this new layout?
- ‚úÖ Buttons and colors match existing design system

## üîç Specific Concerns

<!-- List any particular areas of concern or questions -->

1. **Information Density**
   - Current design: Information spread across 4 tabs
   - Proposed: All on one page with scrolling
   - Concern: Is this too much cognitive load for users?
   - Question: Should we keep tabs but improve the layout within each tab?

2. **Mobile Experience**
   - Proposed design stacks cards vertically on mobile
   - Concern: Very long page on mobile devices
   - Question: Should we use an accordion pattern for mobile instead?
   - Question: Should some sections be collapsed by default on mobile?

3. **Contract History Timeline**
   - Visual timeline looks great in mockup
   - Concern: What if employee has 10+ contracts? Timeline becomes very long
   - Question: Should we limit to most recent 3 and add "View All" button?
   - Question: How to handle employees with no contract history?

4. **Status Badge Prominence**
   - Design places large status badge next to employee name
   - Concern: "Inactive" badge might be too prominent/negative
   - Question: Should inactive employees have more subtle indication?
   - Question: Should we use different colors (currently red for inactive)?

5. **Action Button Placement**
   - Sticky action bar at top (Edit, Deactivate, Delete)
   - Concern: Delete button might be too easily accessible
   - Question: Should destructive actions require confirmation modal?
   - Question: Should action bar disappear on scroll to save space?

6. **Performance on Large Datasets**
   - Employee might have 100+ payroll entries, 50+ leave requests
   - Question: Do we load everything or just recent items?
   - Question: Do we need pagination or infinite scroll?

7. **Permission-Based UI**
   - Some cards should only be visible to managers (salary, contracts)
   - Question: How to handle empty grid gaps when user lacks permissions?
   - Question: Should we rearrange grid dynamically based on permissions?

## üìù Session Notes

<!-- Add any additional context, constraints, or references -->

**Design Goals:**
- Reduce time to find key employee information by 50%
- Improve mobile usability (current mobile experience is poor)
- Create reusable card components for other detail pages
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**User Feedback on Current Design:**
- "I have to click through 3 tabs to see contract and salary info" - Manager
- "Mobile view is unusable, I always switch to desktop" - HR Admin
- "Hard to tell if employee is active or terminated at a glance" - Admin
- "I want to see leave balance without opening separate page" - Manager

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must use existing component library (can create new components)
- Must work with existing API endpoints (no backend changes)
- Must support all current permissions (role-based access)
- Must maintain URL structure (/employees/[employeeId])

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome/Edge (latest 2 versions) - Primary
- Firefox (latest 2 versions) - Primary
- Safari (latest 2 versions) - Secondary
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile) - Critical

**Design System References:**
- Existing card component: `/src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- Existing badge component: `/src/components/ui/badge.tsx`
- Grid layout examples: Dashboard page uses 4-column grid
- Timeline component: May need to create new (reference: GitHub timeline)

## ‚úÖ Start Session

Ready to begin design review. Please:
1. Load all required context documents (ui-context.md, styling-context.md, component-context.md)
2. Review the design scope and proposed changes
3. Analyze each review criterion (functionality, usability, accessibility, performance, maintainability, consistency)
4. Address each specific concern with recommendations
5. Evaluate against existing UI patterns in the codebase
6. Identify potential issues or improvements:
   - Information architecture problems
   - Accessibility gaps
   - Responsive design challenges
   - Performance implications
   - Consistency with design system
7. Suggest best practices and alternatives:
   - Progressive disclosure for dense information
   - Skeleton loaders for perceived performance
   - Keyboard navigation patterns
   - Error state handling
   - Empty state designs
8. Provide actionable recommendations:
   - Prioritized list of must-fix issues
   - Nice-to-have improvements
   - Alternative approaches to consider
   - Implementation notes for developers

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. Should we proceed with card-based layout or stick with tabs?
2. How do we handle information density without overwhelming users?
3. What's the best approach for mobile responsiveness?
4. Are there accessibility concerns that must be addressed?
5. Should we standardize this pattern across all detail pages?
