-- Baseline Migration
-- This migration represents the initial state of the database
-- Created from existing schema after consolidating all previous migrations

-- This migration file is intentionally empty as the database schema
-- already exists and matches the current Prisma schema
-- This serves as a baseline for future migrations

-- Database schema includes:
-- - All enum types (AttributeDataType, AuthorizationLevel, etc.)
-- - All business tables (businesses, business_memberships, etc.)
-- - All employee management tables (employees, job_titles, etc.)
-- - All sync system tables (sync_nodes, sync_events, etc.)
-- - All project and construction tables
-- - All vehicle management tables
-- - All user and authentication tables

-- This baseline migration marks the current database state as migration point zero
