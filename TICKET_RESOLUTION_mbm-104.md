# mbm-104: Fix Business Category Sharing Issue - RESOLUTION SUMMARY

**Ticket ID**: mbm-104  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Resolution Date**: October 31, 2025

---

## 🎯 Problem Summary

**Original Issue**: When creating a new business, the inventory category and subcategory dropdowns were empty, preventing users from adding inventory items.

**Root Cause**: Categories were incorrectly queried by individual `businessId` instead of `businessType`, causing:
- Each business to have an isolated category pool
- New businesses to start with zero categories
- Inability to share categories across businesses of the same type

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Architecture Change

Transformed category system from **business-instance isolation** to **business-type sharing**:

**Before (Broken)**:
```
Business A (clothing) → Categories A (isolated)
Business B (clothing) → Categories B (isolated)  
Business C (clothing) → Categories C (empty!) ❌
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```
Business A (clothing) ──┐
Business B (clothing) ──┼──> Shared Categories (by type) ✅
Business C (clothing) ──┘
```

### Technical Implementation

1. **Schema Migration**
   - Changed unique constraint from `[businessId, name]` to `[businessType, name]`
   - Migration: `20251031000000_shared_categories_by_type`
   - Consolidated 1 duplicate category during pre-migration

2. **API Changes**
   - Updated GET `/api/inventory/[businessId]/categories` to query by `businessType`
   - Updated POST `/api/inventory/[businessId]/categories` to create type-level shared categories
   - Added duplicate prevention at type level

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Products remain business-specific (not shared)
   - Categories shared across all businesses of same type
   - User-created categories properly flagged (`isUserCreated: true`)

### Database State Verification
```sql
-- Category counts by business type (after fix)
SELECT "businessType", COUNT(*) as category_count
FROM business_categories
WHERE "isActive" = true
GROUP BY "businessType";

Result:
  clothing:   5 categories
  grocery:    6 categories
  hardware:   5 categories
  restaurant: 8 categories
```

### Unique Constraint Verification
```sql
SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'business_categories'::regclass 
  AND conname = 'business_categories_businessType_name_key';

Result: 1 row (constraint exists and enforced)
```
