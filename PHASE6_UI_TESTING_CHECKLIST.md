## Color Scheme Reference

- Dark mode: `dark:bg-purple-900/20`, `dark:text-purple-300`, `dark:border-purple-800`
- Badge: `bg-purple-100`, `text-purple-700`
- Dark badge: `dark:bg-purple-900/30`, `dark:text-purple-300`

- Dark mode: `dark:bg-yellow-900/20`, `dark:text-yellow-300`, `dark:border-yellow-800`

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Legacy Supplier Numbers**: 
   - Existing suppliers may have old format (SUP-001)
   - New suppliers will have type-prefixed format (CLO-SUP-001)
   - Both formats work correctly
   - Consider batch renaming if desired

2. **Supplier Editor businessId**:
   - Supplier editor still receives businessId prop
   - API uses businessType internally
   - No UI changes needed for this

3. **Grid Components**:
   - UniversalSupplierGrid automatically works with shared suppliers
   - No updates needed (queries via API which uses businessType)
   - Consider adding SHARED badge to grid view in future
