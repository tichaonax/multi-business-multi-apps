# Business Deactivation UX Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto-Switch After Business Deactivation
**File:** `src/app/business/manage/page.tsx`

**Problem:** When a business was deactivated, the user remained on the deleted business context, causing confusion.

**Solution:** After successful business deactivation:
- Automatically switches to the first available active business
- Shows toast notification indicating the switch
- If no active businesses remain, redirects to dashboard with a helpful message
- Prevents user from being "stuck" on an inactive business

**Code:**
```typescript
onSuccess={async () => {
  setShowDeleteBusiness(false)
  toast.push('Business deactivated successfully')
  
  // Auto-switch to another active business
  const otherBusinesses = activeBusinesses.filter(b => b.businessId !== currentBusiness.businessId)
  
  if (otherBusinesses.length > 0) {
    // Switch to the first available business
    await switchBusiness(otherBusinesses[0].businessId)
    toast.push(`Switched to ${otherBusinesses[0].businessName}`)
  } else {
    // No active businesses left - redirect to dashboard
    toast.push('No active businesses remaining. Please select or create a business.')
    router.push('/dashboard')
  }
}}
```

### 2. View Inactive Businesses Page
**File:** `src/app/business/inactive/page.tsx` (already existed)

**Features:**
- Lists all deactivated businesses (system admin only)
- Shows business details (name, type, description, dates)
- One-click reactivation button for each business
- Informational panel explaining soft delete behavior
- Responsive grid layout

**Access:** Only system administrators can access this page

### 3. Admin Quick Link
**File:** `src/app/business/manage/page.tsx`

**Addition:** Added an admin-only section at the top of the business management page with:
- Blue info panel highlighting admin privileges
- "View Inactive Businesses" button
- Quick access without navigating through menus

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Deactivating with Other Active Businesses
1. User clicks "Delete Business"
2. Confirms deactivation
3. ‚úÖ **Auto-switches to another active business**
4. Toast notification: "Business deactivated successfully"
5. Toast notification: "Switched to [Business Name]"
6. User continues working in the new business context

### Scenario 2: Deactivating the Last Business
1. User clicks "Delete Business"
2. Confirms deactivation
3. ‚úÖ **Redirects to dashboard**
4. Toast notification: "Business deactivated successfully"
5. Toast notification: "No active businesses remaining. Please select or create a business."
6. User prompted to create or join another business

### Scenario 3: Viewing/Reactivating Inactive Businesses
1. Admin goes to `/business/manage`
2. Sees blue admin panel at top
3. Clicks "üóÉÔ∏è View Inactive Businesses"
4. ‚úÖ **Sees all deactivated businesses**
5. Clicks "Reactivate" on any business
6. Business becomes active again
7. List refreshes to show updated status

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/admin/businesses/inactive` - Fetch deactivated businesses (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/businesses/[id]` - Soft delete (deactivate) business
- `PUT /api/admin/businesses/[id]` - Reactivate business (via modal)

## Benefits

1. **No Orphaned State:** User never stuck on inactive business
2. **Seamless Transition:** Automatic switch to valid business context
3. **Easy Recovery:** One-click access to view and reactivate businesses
4. **Clear Feedback:** Toast messages guide user through transitions
5. **Admin Visibility:** Dedicated page for managing inactive businesses
6. **Data Preservation:** Soft delete preserves all business data

## Technical Notes

- Uses existing `BusinessReactivationModal` component
- Leverages `switchBusiness()` from business context
- Respects admin-only permissions
- Maintains consistent UI patterns with existing pages
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Deactivate business with multiple active businesses ‚Üí auto-switches
- [x] Deactivate last active business ‚Üí redirects to dashboard
- [x] View inactive businesses as admin ‚Üí page loads
- [x] Reactivate business ‚Üí returns to active state
- [x] Non-admin cannot access inactive businesses page
- [x] Toast notifications display correctly
- [x] Business switcher updates after deactivation

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/business/manage/page.tsx` - Auto-switch logic + admin link + read-only protection + refresh after reactivation
2. `src/app/business/inactive/page.tsx` - Added context refresh after reactivation
3. `src/app/api/user/business-memberships/route.ts` - Fixed admin filtering to exclude inactive businesses
4. `src/contexts/business-permissions-context.tsx` - Added inactive business switch prevention + refreshBusinesses function

## Critical Security: Read-Only Inactive Businesses

### Problem
Inactive businesses were still editable, allowing data modification on deactivated businesses.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Prevent Inactive Businesses in Switcher
**File:** `src/app/api/user/business-memberships/route.ts`
- System admins: Query filters by `isActive: true`
- Regular users: Combined check `membership.isActive && business.isActive`
- **Result:** Inactive businesses never appear in BusinessSwitcher dropdown

#### 2. Block Switching to Inactive Business
**File:** `src/contexts/business-permissions-context.tsx`
- Added explicit check in `switchBusiness()` function
- Shows toast error: "Cannot switch to inactive business. Please reactivate it first."
- Throws error to prevent switch
- **Result:** Impossible to select inactive business as current

#### 3. Read-Only Mode UI Protection
**File:** `src/app/business/manage/page.tsx`

**Visual Warning:**
- Large red warning banner at top of page
- Lists all restrictions (no edit, no member changes, no data modification)
- Shows "Reactivate This Business" button for admins

**Disabled Actions:**
- ‚ùå Edit Business button (hidden)
- ‚ùå Delete Business button (hidden)  
- ‚ùå Invite Member button (hidden)
- ‚ùå Edit Member button (hidden)
- ‚ùå Remove Member button (hidden)
- ‚ùå Invite Form (completely hidden)
- ‚úÖ Reactivate button (visible for admins)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// All edit actions check: currentBusiness?.isActive
{hasPermission('canInviteUsers') && currentBusiness?.isActive && (
  <button>Invite Member</button>
)}
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Inactive business does NOT appear in BusinessSwitcher
- [ ] Cannot manually switch to inactive business (via URL or code)
- [ ] Red warning banner appears on manage page
- [ ] All edit/delete/invite buttons hidden
- [ ] Admin can see "Reactivate" button
- [ ] After reactivation, all edit functions restore
- [ ] Data remains viewable (read-only access works)
- [x] **After reactivation, business immediately appears in sidebar** (no browser refresh needed)

## Ghost Member Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Business had 1 active membership that wasn't visible in UI

**Solution:** Created `fix-ghost-member.js` script to:
- Query `business_memberships` table for active records
- Identify orphaned/hidden memberships
- Deactivate problematic membership
- Allow business deletion to proceed

**Business:** Savanna Restaurant (`24e38355-84dc-4356-bfb7-7a7ae504e01b`)
**Member:** Bob Smith (bob@test.com)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - membership deactivated, business can now be deleted
