## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Simple UI update (no API changes needed)
- Data already available in `UniversalInventoryItem` interface
- `sellPrice` field already populated by API
- Just needed to be displayed

### Code Quality
- Follows existing patterns
- Consistent styling with other columns
- Maintains responsive design
- Proper TypeScript typing

### Performance
- **Zero performance impact**
- No additional API calls
- No new data fetching
- Simple display logic

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Shared Suppliers (Planned)
Following the exact pattern from mbm-104 (Category Sharing):

1. **Analysis** ✅ Complete
   - Current state: 2 suppliers, 0 duplicates
   - Pattern defined (same as categories)
   - Scripts ready

2. **Schema Migration** (Planned)
   - Change constraint: `[businessId, supplierNumber]` → `[businessType, supplierNumber]`
   - Consolidate duplicates (none found)
   - Update relationships

3. **API Updates** (Planned)
   - Query by `businessType` instead of `businessId`
   - Prevent duplicates by type
   - Maintain product relationships

4. **Testing** (Planned)
   - 100% test coverage (like mbm-104)
   - All business types
   - Edge cases

**Estimated Timeline:** 4 days (~21 hours)
