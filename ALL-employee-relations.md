## Critical Finding: Employee Frontend Interface is INCOMPLETE!

The current Employee interface in `/src/app/employees/page.tsx` only has:
- `users` ✅
- `jobTitles` ✅  
- `compensationTypes` ✅
- `business` ✅
- `employees` ✅ (supervisor)
- `employeeContracts` (partially referenced)

**MISSING 22+ OTHER RELATIONS!**

This explains why:
1. Employee contracts aren't showing (wrong interface)
2. Employee benefits aren't available
3. Leave balances missing
4. Disciplinary actions missing
5. Salary increases missing
6. Attendance data missing
7. Loan information missing
8. Business assignments incomplete

## Next Steps Required

1. **Create test endpoints for ALL 28 relations**
2. **Test EVERY relation individually with camelCase naming**
3. **Create comprehensive Employee interface with ALL relations**
4. **Update Employee Management UI to handle ALL relations**
5. **Test complete Employee API with ALL includes**

## Relation Name Patterns (ALL camelCase)
- Single relation: `jobTitles`, `business`, `users` 
- Array relations: `employeeContracts`, `employeeBenefits`, etc.
- Self-referencing: `employees` (supervisor), `otherEmployees` (subordinates)
- Approval relations: `approvedBonuses`, `approvedLoans`, etc.
- Process relations: `processedLoanPayments`, etc.

This is why the Employee Management UI is broken - we're only testing 20% of the actual relations!
