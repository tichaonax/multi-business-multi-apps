# Business Deletion - Impact Analysis & Implementation Plan

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Add business deletion capability to `/business/manage` page  
**Current State**: DELETE endpoint exists but only deactivates; no UI implementation

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current Implementation
- **DELETE API** exists at `/api/admin/businesses/[id]` but only **deactivates** (sets `isActive: false`)
- **Safety Check**: Prevents deletion if active memberships or employees exist
- **No UI**: Currently no delete button or confirmation modal in the management page
- **Permission**: Requires `isSystemAdmin` role

### Proposed Implementation
Add a **hard delete** capability with:
- UI button on `/business/manage` page
- Multi-step confirmation modal with warnings
- Automatic cleanup of all related data via Prisma cascades + manual cleanup
- Audit logging of deletion
- Demo business identification ([Demo] suffix) for safe deletion

---

## 2. DATABASE IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Tables with CASCADE DELETE (Auto-cleanup)
These will be automatically deleted when a business is deleted:

1. **business_accounts** - ‚úÖ Cascades (line 72)
2. **business_memberships** - ‚úÖ Cascades (line 165)  
3. **customer_laybys** - ‚úÖ Cascades (line 356)
4. **inter_business_loans** (as borrower) - ‚úÖ Cascades (line 1330)
5. **inter_business_loans** (as lender) - ‚úÖ Cascades (line 1371)
6. **payroll_periods** - ‚úÖ Cascades (line 1595)

### Tables WITHOUT CASCADE (Manual Cleanup Required)
These reference `businessId` but don't have `onDelete: Cascade`:

1. **business_brands** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
2. **business_categories** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
3. **business_customers** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
4. **business_orders** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
5. **business_products** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
   - Also affects: `product_variants`, `product_attributes`, `product_images`
   - Also affects: `business_stock_movements`
6. **business_suppliers** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
7. **business_locations** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
8. **business_transactions** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
9. **employees** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
   - Also affects: `employee_contracts`, `employee_business_assignments`
10. **projects** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
    - Also affects: `project_contractors`, project expenses, etc.
11. **vehicles** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
    - Also affects: `vehicle_trips`, `vehicle_expenses`, `vehicle_reimbursements`
12. **menu_combos** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
13. **menu_promotions** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade
14. **payroll_exports** - ‚ö†Ô∏è No cascade

### Critical Foreign Key Constraints
```
business_categories ‚Üí business_products (categoryId)
business_products ‚Üí product_variants (productId)
product_variants ‚Üí business_stock_movements (productVariantId)
business_orders ‚Üí business_order_items (orderId)
projects ‚Üí project_contractors (projectId)
employees ‚Üí employee_contracts (employeeId)
```

## 3. DELETION STRATEGY

### Option A: Soft Delete (Current Implementation)
**What it does**: Sets `isActive: false`, preserves all data
- ‚úÖ Safest option - no data loss
- ‚úÖ Can be reversed
- ‚úÖ Maintains referential integrity
- ‚ùå Clutters database with inactive records
- ‚ùå Not truly "deleting" the business

### Option B: Hard Delete with Manual Cleanup (Recommended)
**What it does**: Physically removes business and all related data
- ‚úÖ Truly removes the business
- ‚úÖ Cleans up database
- ‚úÖ Good for demo data cleanup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful ordering to avoid FK violations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Irreversible - need strong confirmation

### Recommended Approach: **Hybrid**
- **Demo businesses** (`[Demo]` in name): Allow hard delete
- **Real businesses**: Require soft delete (deactivation) OR hard delete with extra confirmation

---

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Update DELETE API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/admin/businesses/[id]/route.ts`

**Changes needed**:
```typescript
1. Add query parameter: ?hardDelete=true
2. If hardDelete=true:
   a. Check if business name contains '[Demo]' for safer deletion
   b. Delete all related records in correct order:
      - business_order_items (via orders)
      - business_orders
      - business_stock_movements
      - product_variants
      - product_attributes, product_images
      - business_products
      - business_categories
      - business_suppliers
      - business_locations
      - business_transactions
      - project_contractors (via projects)
      - projects
      - employee_contracts
      - employee_business_assignments
      - employees
      - vehicle_trips, vehicle_expenses, vehicle_reimbursements
      - vehicles
      - menu_combos, menu_promotions
      - payroll_exports
      - Finally: DELETE business (cascades handle remaining)
   c. Create audit log
3. If hardDelete=false (default):
   - Use existing soft delete logic
```

### Phase 2: Create Deletion Service/Utility
**New File**: `src/lib/business-deletion-service.ts`

**Purpose**: Centralized deletion logic to handle complex cascade
```typescript
export async function deleteBusinessHard(businessId: string, userId: string) {
  // Use Prisma transaction to ensure atomicity
  // Delete in correct dependency order
  // Return detailed result with counts
}
```

### Phase 3: Add UI Components
**File**: `src/app/business/manage/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Add "Delete Business" button (visible to system admins only)
2. Check if business has `[Demo]` suffix
3. If demo: Show "Safe to Delete" indicator
4. On click: Open confirmation modal

**New Component**: `src/components/business/business-deletion-modal.tsx`
```typescript
- Multi-step confirmation
- Show warning about related data:
  * X members will be removed
  * X products will be deleted
  * X orders will be deleted
  * etc.
- Require typing business name to confirm
- Option for hard vs soft delete
- Loading state during deletion
- Success/error feedback
```

### Phase 4: Update Permissions
**File**: `src/types/permissions.ts`

**Current**: `canDeleteBusiness` permission exists
**Action**: Verify it's properly checked in API and UI

---

## 5. SAFETY MEASURES

### Pre-Delete Checks
```typescript
1. ‚úÖ User must be system admin
2. ‚úÖ Check for active memberships (already implemented)
3. ‚úÖ Check for active employees (already implemented)
4. üÜï Count related records and warn user:
   - Products, Orders, Categories, etc.
5. üÜï Require explicit confirmation:
   - Type business name to confirm
   - For non-demo: require typing "DELETE PERMANENTLY"
6. üÜï Demo business detection:
   - If name contains '[Demo]': Allow easier deletion
   - If not demo: Extra warnings and confirmations
```

### Audit Trail
```typescript
1. ‚úÖ Log business deletion (already implemented)
2. üÜï Log detailed information:
   - Related records deleted (counts by type)
   - User who performed deletion
   - Timestamp
   - Business details (name, type, description)
3. üÜï Store deleted business summary in audit log details
```

### Transaction Safety
```typescript
1. üÜï Wrap entire deletion in Prisma transaction
2. üÜï If any step fails, rollback everything
3. üÜï Detailed error reporting
```

## 6. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Accidental deletion of real business** | üî¥ CRITICAL | Multi-step confirmation, require typing business name, extra warnings for non-demo |
| **Foreign key constraint violations** | üü† HIGH | Delete in correct order (children first), use transaction |
| **Data loss without backup** | üî¥ CRITICAL | Suggest creating backup before deletion, audit logging |
| **User deletes wrong business** | üî¥ CRITICAL | Show business details prominently, require exact name match |
| **Incomplete deletion leaves orphaned records** | üü° MEDIUM | Use transaction, verify all related tables covered |
| **Performance impact on large businesses** | üü° MEDIUM | Add loading indicator, consider background job for large deletions |

---

## 7. USER EXPERIENCE FLOW

### For Demo Businesses (Contains `[Demo]`)
```
1. User clicks "Delete Business" button
2. Modal shows:
   ‚úì "This is a demo business - safe to delete"
   ‚úì Summary of related data to be deleted
   ‚úì Single confirmation prompt
3. User confirms
4. Deletion proceeds with loading indicator
5. Success message ‚Üí Redirect to business list or dashboard
```

### For Real Businesses
```
1. User clicks "Delete Business" button
2. Modal shows:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è "WARNING: This will permanently delete all business data"
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Detailed list of related records
   ‚ö†Ô∏è "This action cannot be undone"
3. User must type exact business name
4. User must type "DELETE PERMANENTLY"
5. Deletion proceeds with loading indicator
6. Success message ‚Üí Redirect
```

## 8. TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Business deletion service deletes all related records
- [ ] Transaction rollback on error
- [ ] Proper order of deletion (no FK violations)
- [ ] Audit log creation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] DELETE endpoint with hardDelete=true
- [ ] DELETE endpoint with hardDelete=false (soft delete)
- [ ] Permission checks (system admin only)
- [ ] Safety checks (active members/employees)

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Delete demo business successfully
- [ ] Verify all related records deleted
- [ ] Attempt to delete with active members (should fail)
- [ ] Attempt to delete as non-admin (should fail)
- [ ] Cancel deletion at each confirmation step
- [ ] Verify audit logs created
- [ ] Test on each business type (clothing, restaurant, etc.)

---

## 9. ROLLOUT PLAN

### Development Steps
1. Create business deletion service (`business-deletion-service.ts`)
2. Update DELETE API endpoint with hardDelete option
3. Create business deletion modal component
4. Add delete button to `/business/manage` page
5. Add unit tests
6. Manual testing with demo businesses
7. Code review
8. Deploy to staging
9. Final testing
10. Production deployment

### Monitoring
- Monitor audit logs for business deletions
- Watch for error rates in deletion endpoint
- Track time to complete deletions

---

## 10. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES CONSIDERED

### Approach 1: Background Job
**Pros**: No UI blocking, handles large businesses better  
**Cons**: More complex, need job queue, user can't see immediate result  
**Decision**: Keep synchronous for now, revisit if performance issues

### Approach 2: Export Before Delete
**Pros**: Automatic backup before deletion  
**Cons**: Adds complexity, storage concerns  
**Decision**: Suggest manual export, don't force it

### Approach 3: Cascade All Relations in Schema
**Pros**: Simpler deletion logic  
**Cons**: Risky - one wrong delete cascades everything  
**Decision**: Keep manual control, too dangerous to cascade everything

## 11. FILES TO MODIFY/CREATE

### New Files
- [ ] `src/lib/business-deletion-service.ts` - Core deletion logic
- [ ] `src/components/business/business-deletion-modal.tsx` - UI modal
- [ ] `BUSINESS_DELETION_IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md` - This document

### Modified Files
- [ ] `src/app/api/admin/businesses/[id]/route.ts` - Add hardDelete logic
- [ ] `src/app/business/manage/page.tsx` - Add delete button and modal
- [ ] `src/types/permissions.ts` - Verify canDeleteBusiness permission

---

## 12. QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDER

1. **Deletion Type**: Should we allow hard delete for ALL businesses or only demo businesses?
2. **Backup Requirement**: Should we force an export/backup before deletion?
3. **Confirmation Level**: Is requiring typing business name sufficient, or need more?
4. **Soft Delete Option**: Should UI offer both soft and hard delete options?
5. **Background Jobs**: For large businesses, should deletion be async/background job?

## 13. ESTIMATED EFFORT

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Business deletion service | 2-3 hours |
| API endpoint update | 1-2 hours |
| UI deletion modal | 2-3 hours |
| Integration into manage page | 1 hour |
| Testing (unit + manual) | 2-3 hours |
| Documentation | 1 hour |
| Code review + fixes | 1-2 hours |
| **Total** | **10-15 hours** |

## 14. SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ System admin can delete demo businesses with clear warnings  
‚úÖ All related data is cleaned up (no orphaned records)  
‚úÖ Non-demo businesses have extra protection (stricter confirmation)  
‚úÖ Audit logs capture all deletions with details  
‚úÖ No FK constraint violations during deletion  
‚úÖ Transaction rollback works on errors  
‚úÖ UI provides clear feedback during deletion process  
‚úÖ Cannot delete business with active members/employees  

---

## 15. RECOMMENDATION

**Proceed with Hybrid Approach (Option B with safeguards)**:
- Implement hard delete capability
- Extra protections for non-demo businesses
- Clear warnings and multi-step confirmation
- Demo business identification makes testing safer
- Proper ordering prevents FK violations
- Audit logging maintains accountability

This approach balances the need to clean up demo data (which was the original request) with the safety requirements for production business data.
