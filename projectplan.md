# Modify Dashboard to Show Users with Business Assignments

## Problem Analysis
The current dashboard shows separate Users and Employees sections, but the requirement is to:
- Use ONLY the Users table (no separate employees table display)
- Show each user with their business assignments
- Highlight the primary business assignment with a different color
- Display format: "Mary Hwandaza, mary@hxi.com, user, 2 businesses"

## Current System Analysis
Looking at the existing `/api/dashboard/team-breakdown` endpoint, it currently:
- Fetches Users with businessMemberships
- Fetches Employees separately
- Shows both as separate sections

**Target:** Consolidate to show only Users with enhanced business assignment display.

## Plan

### Todo Items:
- [ ] Modify the team-breakdown API to focus on Users only
- [ ] Enhance user data to include business count and primary business logic
- [ ] Update the frontend dashboard to display users with business assignments
- [ ] Add visual styling to highlight primary business assignments
- [ ] Remove or hide the separate employees section
- [ ] Test the enhanced user display

### Changes Required:

1. **API Changes** (`src/app/api/dashboard/team-breakdown/route.ts`):
   - Keep the Users section but enhance it with business assignment details
   - Add logic to identify primary business for each user
   - Remove or minimize the Employees section
   - Add business count per user

2. **Frontend Changes** (dashboard components):
   - Update user display to show business assignments
   - Add color coding for primary business
   - Show business count per user
   - Format: "Name, Email, Role, X businesses"

3. **Data Structure:**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string,
     name: string,
     email: string,
     role: string,
     businessCount: number,
     primaryBusiness: {
       name: string,
       type: string,
       isPrimary: true
     },
     otherBusinesses: BusinessAssignment[]
   }
   ```

### Expected Outcome:
- Single unified user list showing business assignments
- Primary business highlighted with different color
- Clear display of business count per user
- Simplified dashboard with better user context

**Visual Improvements:**

- **Other Businesses**: Gray background with "OTHER" badge
- **Business Count**: Clear display of "X businesses" per user
- **Role Display**: User role prominently shown
- **Responsive Layout**: Proper spacing and mobile-friendly design

**Expected Display Format (as requested):**
```

mary@hxi.com
user
2 businesses
  [PRIMARY] TechCorp Solutions (Restaurant) - Manager
  [OTHER]   Clothing Store (Clothing) - Employee
```

**Simple Enhancement:** This change consolidates team member display into a single, comprehensive view that shows users with their business assignments and clearly highlights their primary business relationships.
