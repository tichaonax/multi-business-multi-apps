# Remote Server Quick Fix Guide

**Issue:** Remote server not showing new logging (üìù Spawning, üîç Verifying, etc.)
**Cause:** Code hasn't been updated on remote server
**Fix:** Pull latest code and restart service

---

## Step 1: Pull Latest Code (on Remote Server)

```bash
cd /path/to/multi-business-multi-apps

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

**Expected Output:**
```
remote: Counting objects: 12, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
remote: Total 12 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.

## Step 2: Verify Code Updated

```bash
# Quick verification
npm run verify:service-wrapper
```

**Expected Output:**
```
======================================================================
üîç SERVICE WRAPPER VERIFICATION TOOL
======================================================================

‚úÖ Service wrapper file found
‚úÖ Service wrapper loaded (1420 lines, 46119 bytes)

‚úÖ FOUND: startApplication() method at line 1039
‚úÖ FOUND: checkPortListening() method at line 981
‚úÖ FOUND: verifyNextJsStarted() method at line 1001
‚úÖ FOUND: verifyNextJsAvailable() method at line 1026
‚úÖ FOUND: Direct node spawn (not npm) at line 1067
‚úÖ FOUND: shell: false option at line 1070
‚úÖ FOUND: appProcess property in constructor at line 52
‚úÖ OLD CODE REMOVED: OLD PATTERN: npm spawn (should NOT exist)

‚úÖ SERVICE WRAPPER HAS ALL FIXES APPLIED
‚úÖ Old code has been removed
```

**If verification fails:**
```bash
# Check what commit you're on
git log -1 --oneline

# Should show: 56ee1f1 or e528f6a or later

# If still on old commit, try:
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
npm run verify:service-wrapper
```

---

## Step 3: Restart Service (as Administrator)

```powershell
# Open PowerShell as Administrator

cd "C:\path\to\multi-business-multi-apps"

# Stop service
npm run service:stop

# Wait 5 seconds
timeout /t 5

# Start service
npm run service:start
```

---

## Step 4: Watch Service Logs

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f logs/service.log
```

**What to Look For (NEW LOGGING):**

```
üöÄ Starting Multi-Business Sync Service (Hybrid Mode)...
üîí Running production validation and safety checks...
‚úÖ All production validation checks passed
‚úÖ Sync service started with PID: 12345

üî® Building Next.js application...
‚úÖ Application build already exists, skipping build

üöÄ Starting Multi-Business Next.js application...    <-- NEW
‚úÖ Next.js binary found.                              <-- NEW
üìù Spawning: node C:\...\next start                  <-- NEW (KEY LOG)
üìÇ Working directory: C:\...                          <-- NEW
üîå PORT: 8080                                         <-- NEW
üìå Next.js process spawned with PID: 67890           <-- NEW

[Next.js] ‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.5.4                          <-- NEW
[Next.js] - Local: http://localhost:8080            <-- NEW

üîç Verifying Next.js is listening...                 <-- NEW (KEY LOG)
‚úÖ Next.js is now listening on port 8080.            <-- NEW
üöÄ SERVICE STARTUP COMPLETE                          <-- NEW
üåê Application available at: http://localhost:8080   <-- NEW
```

**If you DON'T see these logs:**
- The code still hasn't been updated
- Service needs another restart
- Run verification again

---

## Step 5: Test Port 8080

```bash
# Check if port is listening
powershell -Command "Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue"

# Test HTTP response
curl http://localhost:8080

# Test in browser
# http://your-server-ip:8080
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Still showing old logs?

```bash
# 1. Verify file was actually updated
ls -la windows-service/service-wrapper-hybrid.js
# Should show recent timestamp

# 2. Check file size
wc -c windows-service/service-wrapper-hybrid.js
# Should be around 46000-47000 bytes

# 3. Search for new logging
grep "üìù Spawning:" windows-service/service-wrapper-hybrid.js
# Should find it

# 4. Search for old code
grep "spawn(npmCmd, \['run', 'start'\]" windows-service/service-wrapper-hybrid.js
# Should find NOTHING
```

### Git pull did nothing?

```bash
# Check if you're behind
git status

# If behind, pull again
git pull origin main

# If has local changes, stash them
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
```

### Service won't restart?

```powershell
# Force kill any node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Wait 5 seconds
timeout /t 5

# Kill processes on ports
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).OwningProcess -Force"
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8765 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).OwningProcess -Force"

# Wait 5 seconds
timeout /t 5

# Start service
npm run service:start
```

## Summary

The key indicator that the fix is working:

**‚úÖ You WILL see:**
- `üìù Spawning: node ...node_modules\next\dist\bin\next start`
- `üîç Verifying Next.js is listening on the configured port...`
- `‚úÖ Next.js is now listening on port 8080.`

**‚ùå You will NOT see:**
- `Starting main application: npm run start` (old log)
- `Main application start requested` (old log)

If you still see the old logs after following these steps, run:
```bash
npm run verify:service-wrapper
```

And share the output - it will tell us exactly what's wrong.
