## Key Changes Made

### 1. Relation Name Fixes (Prisma Queries)
Changed from camelCase to snake_case to match schema `@@map` directives:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
include: {
  jobTitles: true,
  otherEmployees: true,
  employee: true,
  payrollPeriod: true,
  payrollAdjustments: true,
  PayrollEntryBenefits: true,
  employeeBusinessAssignments: true
}

// ✅ AFTER  
include: {
  job_titles: true,
  other_employees: true,
  employees: true,  // Note: plural
  payroll_periods: true,
  payroll_adjustments: true,
  payroll_entry_benefits: true,
  employee_business_assignments: true
}
```

### 2. UI Transformation Layer
Added backward-compatible transformations for UI:

```typescript
// Transform snake_case relations to camelCase for UI
const formattedEmployee = {
  ...e,
  jobTitle: e.job_titles,  // UI expects jobTitle
  subordinates: e.other_employees  // UI expects subordinates
}

// Alias employees->employee for payroll entries
const mappedEntry = {
  ...entry,
  employee: entry.employees  // UI expects singular
}
```

### 3. Created Utilities
- `src/lib/api-response-mapper.ts` - Comprehensive mapper for all models
- `API_TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation of approach

## Remaining Work

### Estimated Files to Validate: ~180

#### High Priority Categories
- [ ] Remaining Employee APIs (6 files)
  - attendance/route.ts
  - create-user/route.ts
  - employee-assignments/route.ts
  - debug/employee-contracts/[employeeNumber]/route.ts
  - [employeeId]/contracts-backup/route.ts
  - [employeeId]/leave-balance/route.ts

- [ ] Remaining Payroll APIs (2 files)
  - periods/route.ts (validated - appears correct)
  - periods/[periodId]/route.ts (validated - appears correct)
  - advances/route.ts (model doesn't exist - skip)

- [ ] Vehicles APIs (5 files) - Validated, all appear correct
  - route.ts ✅
  - trips/route.ts ✅
  - reimbursements/route.ts ✅
  - reports/route.ts ✅

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Contract APIs (remaining)
- [ ] Business APIs (remaining)
- [ ] User Management APIs (remaining)
- [ ] Settings/Configuration APIs
- [ ] Report Generation APIs

#### Low Priority  
- [ ] Admin/Utility APIs
- [ ] Sync/Integration APIs
- [ ] Test/Debug endpoints

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Paths to Test
- [ ] Employee detail page (`/employees/[id]`)
- [ ] Employee list/search (`/employees`)
- [ ] Payroll entry creation
- [ ] Payroll entry viewing/editing
- [ ] Payroll export generation
- [ ] Payroll export regeneration
- [ ] Leave request management
- [ ] Salary increase management
- [ ] Contract management

### Expected Behaviors
✅ All pages should load without "Unknown field" errors
✅ Job titles should display correctly
✅ Employee relationships (supervisor/subordinates) should show
✅ Payroll entries should show employee data
✅ Exports should generate successfully

## Known Issues Resolved
1. ✅ `Unknown field 'jobTitles'` - Fixed by changing to `job_titles`
2. ✅ `Unknown field 'otherEmployees'` - Fixed by changing to `other_employees`  
3. ✅ `Unknown field 'previousContract'` - Fixed by changing to `employee_contracts`
4. ✅ UI expecting `jobTitle` but API returning `job_titles` - Fixed with transformation layer
5. ✅ Payroll entries expecting `employee` but API returning `employees` - Fixed with alias

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Test all fixed endpoints thoroughly
2. Monitor production logs for any "Unknown field" errors
3. Complete validation of remaining high-priority files

### Medium Term  
1. Consider using the mapper utility consistently across all API routes
2. Create TypeScript interfaces for transformed responses
3. Add automated tests for critical endpoints

### Long Term
1. Standardize on transformation approach across entire codebase
2. Consider code generation for API response transformers
3. Document API response contracts for frontend team
